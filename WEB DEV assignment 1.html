            <h2>What are Semantic HTML Tags?</h2>
            <p>Semantic HTML5 tags provide meaning to a web page rather than just presentation. Tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` clearly describe their content to both the browser and the developer.</p>
        </section>

        <!--
            The <article> element is a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site,
            which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable.
        -->
        <article id="benefits">
            <h2>The Benefits of Semantic HTML</h2>
            <!-- Use subheadings to break up content and create a clear hierarchy -->
            <h3>Improved Accessibility</h3>
            <p>Screen readers and other assistive technologies use semantic tags to navigate a page more effectively. For example, the `<nav>` tag lets a screen reader user know that a block of links is for navigation, allowing them to jump directly to it.</p>

            <h3>Better Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h3>
            <p>Search engine crawlers understand the structure of your page better when you use semantic tags. This helps them to index your content more accurately and can lead to better rankings.</p>

            <h3>Cleaner and More Maintainable Code</h3>
            <p>When you use descriptive tags, your code becomes easier for other developers (and your future self!) to read and understand. This leads to more efficient development and maintenance.</p>
        </article>

        <!--
            The <aside> element represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly
            related to the document's main content. It's often presented as a sidebar.
        -->
        <aside aria-label="Related content">
            <h3>Learn More</h3>
            <p>Dive deeper into semantic tags on the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) or other reputable web development resources.</p>

    <!--
        The <footer> element represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content
        or sectioning root element. A <footer> typically contains information about its containing element.
